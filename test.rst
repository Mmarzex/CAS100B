This is a demo for Hovercraft! You can view it as a finished presentation
at http://regebro.github.com/hovercraft/


It's also useful as an example, in which case it's supposed to be read as
`source code <../_sources/examples/hovercraft.txt>`_.

You can render this presentation to HTML with the command::

    hovercraft hovercraft.rst outdir
    
And then view the outdir/index.html file to see how it turned out.

If you are seeing this text, and not reading this as source code, you are
doing it wrong! It's going to be confusing and not very useful.

Use The Source, Luke! But first you probably want to read through the
official documentation at https://hovercraft.readthedocs.org/

Problem Description and Analysis:
=================================

* To maintain the current cost of tuition, Pennsylvania State University must stop unnecessary spending.

.. note::

    Here you have a view of the current slide, a preview of the next slide
    and your notes.

----

* We will refer to Pennsylvania State University as Penn State
* For simplicty when we refer to tuition, we mean Freshman and Sophomore instate tuition costs
* As of the 2013-14 School term tuition is $8,045 (add source)
* When we refer to State aid we mean the aid that the State gives to the University 

.. note::

    If you click on the timer it restarts from zero. This is handy when you
    are rehearsing the presentation and need to make sure it fits in the time
    allocated.

----

* Penn State's careless spending is causing tuition to continue to increase each year
* This is harmful to us as students

----

* As tuition is raised, students take out more loans
* Puts us further in debt in order to obtain a degree

----

* Simply put as we leave school our income cannot pay back what we owe for our education

----

Generating and Elaborating on Possible Solutions:
=================================================

* Large student group with a small executive board that is able to speak with those making financial decisions
* Create a student group to discover and boycott any unnecessary spending

----

* Eliminate constant construction and focus on only most needed projects. For instance, The HUB rennovations are costly and wasteful
* Stop raising the salaries of administrative chairs and athletic coaches and directors. James Franklin will make 4.5 million a year for six years, He is the 7th highest paid college football coach

----

* Students are overpaying for food with the campus meal plan (lower food costs)
* Place the full allocation of PSU spending budget all over campus to raise awareness
* Increase State funding

----

Evalute Possible Solutions:
===========================

* The best way to use all these solutions in combination is to form a small group to raise awareness/boycott/ and change the unncessary spending of PSU

----

* Best Solution: Small student group (initially) to raise awareness of student tuition concerns and why Penn State has such high costs and send a petition to Penn State's Board of Trustees

----

* We find a small group solution necessary to alleviate student tuition costs

----

* Best way is to start with a dedicated group of students and grow the small group. A small group will still exist in the group as the executive board.

----

* Continual newsletters and updates about reducing tuition will keep people involved. Students and parents desire to pay less. As long as the group shows potential in lowering tuition, people will continue to participate and contribute. It will be important for the group to maintain a strong executive committee to continue the effort.

----

* The immediate goal is to form the group and gain awareness. The short term goal is to reduce tuition cost through petition. The long term goal is to maintain a reasonable tuition while reducing unnecessary costs. In all cases, a group will be necessary to solve the problem.

----

* As this is a complex problem requiring knowledge in finance, politics, human resources, education, and many more, a group's collective input and throughput will help in tackling the problem. However, a group may create delays and bureaucracy, inhibiting progress. Collectively, Penn State and The Board of Trustees will listen to student and parent concerns.

----

* The solution will require a dedicated group of students who have the passion and knowledge to promote the cause. The group will need funds for their campaign. In order to spread the correct information, the students will need access to administrative budget sheets and connections to experts.

----

Consensus Decision Making:
==========================

* Create a small group of motivated individuals to spread awareness of the rising tuition of Penn State's main campus
* Small group consisting of an executive board with 5 members, President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Advertiser/Marketing Chair, Event Planner

----

Raise Awareness Through Advertisement:
======================================

* Show specific parts of unnecessary spending in each department
* Illustrate administrative/athletic director salaries
* Display rising tuition graph

----

* Accept new members to form the largest group possible after enough awareness has been proclaimed by the executive board

----

:data-rotate: 90

Implementing The Solution:
==========================

* Small group can post stall stories and allocated budget all over campus
* Small group can petition to administrative and state officials

----

Steps to Implement:
===================
1. Form a small group, containing a faculty member
2. Create the Organization
3. Create an Executive Board, Each board member will hold a position in specific areas useful to the cause

----

4. Gather a large amount of general group members
5. Create petition to create higher awareness and support the cause
